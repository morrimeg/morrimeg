### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently completing my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Oregon State University (expected August 2021).

Currently, I'm taking OSU's Operating Systems 1 class. In the fall I will be taking Algorithms and Intro to Cyber Security.

I currently work in the tech industry as a Data Scientist.
